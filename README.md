#What is an invoice discounting?
Invoice discounting is a financial service where companies receive immediate cash by selling their outstanding invoices to a third-party financier at a discount. This helps improve cash flow and manage working capital without waiting for customers to pay their invoices. The company retains control over its sales ledger and customer relationships.
